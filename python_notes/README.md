# Basic Python Notes

This is a test ground for new python versions functionality. Current tests are Python 3.6.6

If using pipenv:

`pipenv install`

If you're using `venv`:

`pip install jupyter`

If you're using another package manager, look at the dependecies in the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` and install those. This demo uses the `jupyter` library.
