# Basic Scraping

This is basic example of `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` web scraping in a jupyter notebook.

If using pipenv:

`pipenv install`

If you're using `venv`:

`pip install jupyter requests BeautifulSoup4`

If you're using another package manager, look at the dependecies in the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` and install those. This demo uses `jupyter`, `requests`, and `BeautifulSoup4` libraries.
